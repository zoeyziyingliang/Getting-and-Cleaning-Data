# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
as part of Coursera Data Science Specialized Certificate course
## project instruction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## project objectives
This repo contains source datasets (traina and test) and a tidy dataset where train and test datasets are merged and cleansed. In addtional, a code book(CodeBook.md) is also included showing the data profile dataset generated from run_analysis.R
